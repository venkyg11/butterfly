Enchanted Wings: Classification and Analysis of Butterflies
Summary
Enchanted Wings is a classification and analysis capability built using deep learning techniques that can classify and analyze butterflies based on their wing shapes and colors. This capability will allow conservationists, academics, and anyone interested in butterflies to help classify butterfly species with a high degree of accuracy while also investigating the unique 'enchantments' of butterflies' wingsâ€”i.e., iridescence, patterns, and structural colors.

Key Features
Classification of Species: Classify butterfly species based on uploaded photographs.

Wing Pattern Analysis: Characterize unique wing markings, colors, and symmetry.

Detection of Iridescence: Detect and highlight glimmering or metallic effects on wings.

User Experience: Easy API accessible via a web application or mobile friendly web application.

Dataset Insights: Provide ecological or other information on the identified species.

How it Works
Input: User uploads a photograph of a butterfly.

Preprocessing: Prepare the image by enhancement, cropping (to focus primarily on the wings), and normalization.

Prediction: The trained convolutional neural network (CNN; ResNet, EfficientNet, or Vision Transformer) will predict the species.

Analysis: Wing patterns, colors, and iridescence are analyzed.

Output: The final output is the species name, the confidence score, and potentially interesting or fun facts.
