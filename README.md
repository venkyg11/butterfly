Enchanted Wings: Classification and Analysis of Butterflies
Summary
Enchanted Wings is a classification and analysis capability built using deep learning techniques that can classify and analyze butterflies based on their wing shapes and colors. This capability will allow conservationists, academics, and anyone interested in butterflies to help classify butterfly species with a high degree of accuracy while also investigating the unique 'enchantments' of butterflies' wingsâ€”i.e., iridescence, patterns, and structural colors.
